# Bike Ride Analysis 
## _Overview_
This bike trip analysis is aimed to support a business proposal for bike sharing program. For this project, we'll use data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. This data includes a variety of fields such as 
 - Trip Duration
 - Start Time and Date
 - Stop Time and Date
 - Start Station Name
 - End Station Name
 - Station ID
 - Station Lat/Long
 - Bike ID
 - User Type
 - Gender
 - Year of Birth

We intend support our proposal with analysis on the trend of user trips & trip Duration across weekdays, user type and gender. We used the Tableau for visualization of this dataset.

## _Results_
The results are published in the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharingfromTableauDesktop/CheckoutTimesforUsers?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The analysis of trips on trip duration suggest that most of the trips are less than an hour.
