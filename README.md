# Bike Ride Analysis 
## _Overview_
This bike trip analysis is aimed to support a business proposal for bike sharing program. For this project, we'll use data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. This data includes a variety of fields such as 
 - Trip Duration
 - Start Time and Date
 - Stop Time and Date
 - Start Station Name
 - End Station Name
 - Station ID
 - Station Lat/Long
 - Bike ID
 - User Type
 - Gender
 - Year of Birth

We intend support our business proposal with analysis on the trend of user trips & trip Duration across weekdays, user type and gender. We used the Tableau for visualization of this dataset.

## _Results_
The results are published in the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharingfromTableauDesktop/CheckoutTimesforUsers?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The analysis indicate an average trip duration is around 17.5 minutes per trip. The charting across trip duration on an hourly basis across weekdays and the utilization trend of bikes suggest the strong potential for bike sharing rides in any new territory. The analysis are published in Tableau Public in form of worksheets and stories.
